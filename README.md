This is a Next.js starter template with best practices, essential configurations, and a structured folder architecture to kickstart your projects efficiently.

📥 Clone and Install
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git <br/>
cd your-repo <br/>
pnpm install  # or npm install / yarn install

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Best Practices

  This template includes the following configurations to ensure code quality and consistency:
  
  TypeScript (tsconfig.json) – Strict mode enabled for better type safety.
  ESLint (.eslintrc.json) – Enforces best coding practices (including semicolons).
  Prettier (.prettierrc) – Auto-formats code for consistency.
  Middleware Support (middleware.ts) – Handles API authentication, logging, or redirects.
  Prisma ORM (optional) – Database setup for PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.
  Dark Mode Ready – Uses Tailwind CSS dark mode utilities.

## 📌 Next Steps

  Customize your global styles in src/styles/globals.css. <br/>
  Add new pages inside src/app/. <br/>
  Define your components in src/components/. <br/>
  And have a fun.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
